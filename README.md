# 8 Open Source Dataset
## 8.1 STBD-08
Thanks to the CBPH-Net [https://github.com/icedle/CBPH-Net](https://github.com/icedle/CBPH-Net) authors for their contributions, here is the download link for the CBPH-Net contribution dataset STBD-08:

BiTNet: A lightweight object detection network for real-time classroom behavior recognition with transformer and bi-directional pyramid network

CBPH-Net: A Small Object Detector for Behavior Recognition in Classroom Scenarios

The STBD-08 paper claims that the dataset includes 4432 images and 151574 annotations. Nevertheless, when we calculated the data provided by the author, we discovered that the actual quantities are much larger than these figures. Our statistics indicate that the dataset has 8884 images (with 7052 in the training set and 1,832 in the validation set) and 267,888 annotations (including 212,728 in the training set and 55,160 in the validation set).

Through online search, we found that the STBD-08 dataset is completed based on the dataset publicly [sale online](https://mbd.pub/o/bread/ZZiTl5lw) (the dataset also has 8,884 pieces), and the data volume is far lower than that of the dataset publicly sold online.

However, when we cleaned the STBD-08 dataset, we found that there are still many problematic data in it, such as non-standard bounding boxes (bbox) and some class labeling errors.

In other words, the author of STBD-08 has not made the dataset they created public, and only the original dataset purchased online is disclosed.

## 8.2 A dataset of student classroom behavior from a paid website

This dataset is highly similar to STBD-08, mainly in that the images are highly similar and the quality of annotations is also poor

## 8.5 ClaBehavior

The ClaBehavior [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/11/7/372) mentions 1,342 images and 9,911 annotations. However, we actually found only 400 images and 8,083 annotations on [GitHub](https://github.com/CCNUZFW/Student-behavior-detection-system/tree/master/dataset/coco), including:  
- **Train Dataset**: 360 images and 7,250 annotations  
- **Val Dataset**: 40 images and 833 annotations  

The categories include: Write, Read, Lookup, Turn_head, Raise_hand, Stand, Discuss.  

|         | Train | Val  | Total |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Write   | 520   | 59   | 579   |
| read    | 920   | 101  | 1021  |
| lookup  | 4045  | 435  | 4480  |
| turn_head | 915  | 96   | 1011  |
| raise_hand | 569  | 115  | 684   |
| stand   | 58    | 8    | 66    |
| discuss | 223   | 19   | 242   |
| Total   | 7250  | 833  | 8083  |

## 8.6 SCBehavior
The SCBehavior [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/18/8357) mentions that there are 1346 images. However, when we checked the author's [GitHub](https://github.com/CCNUZFW/SCBehavior), we found only 400 damaged images that cannot be viewed (360 in the Train Dataset and 40 in the Val Dataset).

## 8.7 UK_Datasets
[UK_Datasets paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0318817) is derived from the 2019 elementary school classroom videos collected from the National Education Resources Public Service Platform (NERPSP). 

UK_Datasets extracted 8754 images by frame, and considering the detection needs in real classroom scenarios, it classified these images into eight categories of typical student behaviors: writing, reading, listening, raising hands, turning, standing, discussing, and accepting teacher instructions.

The author categorized the test set portions of UK_Datasets according to the degree of occlusion: "Heavy Occlusion (HO)" and "Low Occlusion (LO)".

Unfortunately, when we downloaded the [UK\_Datasets](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/IMRMB-Net_zip/27894246) for statistics, we found that the data was not original. Specifically, it originated from the 2.1 STBD-08 section and the dataset [publicly available online](https://mbd.pub/o/bread/ZZiTl5lw) as introduced in this paper. The author merely divided and counted these existing datasets.

Since the data itself is plagiarized and not original, this paper will not conduct statistical analysis on its data.
